## Overview 
This is a shared library that I created for my suite of electronic calculator Android apps. 
Since many of my apps share similar components, utilities, and styling choices, this library ensures that all shared elements remain consistent across all of the apps. 
By maintaining this module for these components, I can easily push updates to all of my apps without duplicating code.

### Purpose
- Consistency: Ensure uniformity across my apps in terms of reusable UI components, utilities, and core features.
- Maintainability: This avoids code duplication and enable easier maintenance and updates across apps.
- Efficiency: Improves the development process by reusing pre-built, tested components.

This module is not intended for public use, as most of the components and utilities are customized for my apps. 
However, the repository is public for convenience so I can easily create releases to JitPack to use as a dependency in my Android applications.
